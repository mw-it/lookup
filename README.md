# LOOKUP
LOOKUP provides pre-defined and extendable arrays, classes, constants, enums, lists, lookup-tables etc. for your projects.

Nobody has to reinvent the wheel from scratch. Some things were almost the same in the past, they are almost the same at present and they will be almost the same in the future.

For example you have a simple list of week days:
~~~
Weekday:
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Saturday
Sunday
